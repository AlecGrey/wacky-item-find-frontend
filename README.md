## Description

This is a demo of a single page application (SPA) that I made at Flatiron School.  It was a solo-project made over the course of a week, using a JavaScript frontend and a Rails API backend.  All data was pulled from the Etsy database, then seeded in the Rails API.

Github Link for the Rails API backend: https://github.com/AlecGrey/wacky-item-find-backend

For the future I would like to add additional CSS animations, as well as secure account functionality.


## Instructions

- Fork and clone this repo, as well as the [Rails API Backend](https://github.com/AlecGrey/wacky-item-find-backend).
- Begin by seeding your database (this may take some time, as it is making many requests to an external API, and will process until it creates 100 items)
- Run the frontend by navigating to the frontend directory and entering `open index.html` in your command line.
- Have fun!
